      <p>Gravestone w/lightning effect: This gravestone graphic I created is the first entity that readers see when presented with the multi genre work. The scene itself emphasizes the unorthodox approach taken towards the project, which is normally in the format of a pdf. This statement also make the point that where normal projects would likely emphasize the use of extended text over visual stimulus, this will attempt to do the opposite, maximize visual and audio input while still making efficient use of words. Speaking to the image itself, it sets the tone of the piece. This is not some happy-go lucky essay, it explores serious subjects. The lightning in the background of the rundown (as the gravestone in the book must’ve been poor quality as Sethe couldn’t afford engraving) gravestone helps sett the more ominous tone as well. I found that this effect made it rather difficult to read the Dear reader section however, and as such allowed for it to be disabled through the pressing of the home button on the side bar.
</br></br>
Dear Reader: My Dear reader section contextualises the novel in the way I choose to view it for the purpose of the project. Because this project is not fully and completely related to <i> Beloved </i>, and instead uses the novel as a jumping off point, I deviate away from the novel after establishing a connection. I utilized a quote I truly believe, from one of my favorite television characters to summarize how I feel in the wake of a new loss, a sentiment I hope readers share. I sign out with “condolences”, because it frames when I feel people should partake in the ideal form of this project (of which this isn’t).
</br></br>
Homepage Music: The piece playing in the background is somewhat inspired by and based off a 1996 video game track. Video game music is created specifically to distract less than traditional music so people can focus on the game. This makes it a good choice for background music, and was a contributing factor to why I chose this style of music. Furthermore, the setting in the game where the original track was played was a solemn, haunted town (much like 124 is haunted), which contained the only cemetery in the game. To me the track pulls back memories from a much younger age when playing the game.
</br></br>
Religion ‘factoids’: Little explanation is needed here. This small section eases the way into the more in depth sections below. It serves as an opportunity to reconfirm some of the reader’s general knowledge while also integrating words with visuals.
</br></br>
Religion by geography: This segment shows the geographic distribution of practicers of specific religions. This allows the reader to perhaps foresee cultures that may have similar practices and those that will not. It also shows the incredibly broad reach of certain religions, such as Christianity, and the more narrow existence of practices such as Hinduism. As expected, the more isolated practices tended to have similar belief systems, and this graphic somewhat foreshadows that fact.
</br></br>
Beliefs by religion: This is perhaps the segment that required the most research to compete, and also one of the hardest to write. My goal here was to share the practices of, presently, 7 different religious organizations in a simple and brief manner. Each practice is broken into three sections :the post- death, i.e what happens when you die, the mourning time for those left behind, as this is the central theme of the project, and the disposal customs for the body of the deceased. I found that this format allowed for brief summaries of even more particular conditions, and delivered the information in an easy to comprehend manner. Each of the religions are identified by their symbol or logo, as to provide a relevant visual to go along with the information. This tactic is a learning tool, that increases retention. When there are obvious connections between religious customs, I pointed them out in the text themselves to force readers to establish a connection. It seems the most diverse aspect between religions was the mourning practices, this draws attention to them which is the intent of the project.
</br></br>
Religion page music, Everlasting Hymn:
This piece is directly pulled from the 2014 game, “The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth”. It originally is the background track for the stage known as the cathedral. As the name suggests, it is a Hymn of sorts, with only one verse. "You, who awaits God, do not fear, what is left , and he will give you strength"﻿ This line is referring to those who have already or are about to die, making it fit well with the theme of the entire project. As a hymn it sounds quite holy and is fitting for the religious page in the project.
</br></br>
Expository piece:
The expository piece addresses a necessary component of the project. It explores how Sethe is reacting, exposing her guilt, for slaying her daughter once she discovers Beloved (the ghost) to be her daughter. The hidden layer in these piece is in the discrepancy between the actions or desires of Sethe and how others viewed her actions. It shows how when acting out of emotion, in grief often times even actions that are good intentioned are frightening and a bad idea. This shows that the religious practices of taking a period of inactivity to mourn may be well founded as to prevent rash actions that cannot be undone.
</br></br>
The boys: This is a short, light hearted bit detailing the actions of Sethe’s boys. It strongly contrasts the rest of the project, juxtaposing itself and pulling the reader out of the environment provided by the other works.
</br></br>
Paul D: This is a less strict poem that depicts the journey of Paul D after Stamp paid informs him of the horrid happenings. Above each stanza a few words are italicized. These correspond directly to the well known stages of grief. This allows me to direct the reader’s thinking as swiftly and efficiently as possible, without interrupting the poem significantly.
