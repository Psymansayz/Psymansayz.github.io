      <p>Everybody reacts to death (or in <i> Beloved</i>, murder) differently. In this section I look at how people react to the knowledge of death in beloved, and how they reflect on real people's behavior.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Expository</h1>
      <p> The following segment analyzes Sethe's actions after she discovers Beloved to be the ghost and Denver's true thoughts regarding Sethe and her horrid actions</p>
      <p>This segment takes a very different style than the rest of the book, taking up a stream of consciousness style where Sethe, Denver, and even Beloved each get a chapter in their perspective. Here, many truths are revealed about Sethe, and her relationship to her children, starting with beloved. Sethe’s actions tell the reader a bit about what she considers a mother to be. Firstly, she claims that a mother should know who her daughter is. She claims “I would have known right off, but Paul D distracted me.” This acting defensive shows that she truly is bothered by the lack of recognition and considers it to be an important trait of being a mother (391). She also believes that to be a mother you must be with your children, and comfort them. She explains to Beloved that “When I put that headstone up I wanted to lay in there with you, put your head on my shoulder and keep you warm,” to show she was a good mother even though she didn’t recognize her at first (392). Another trait of being a mother is to take a child’s loss as your own. Sethe “couldn't lay down nowhere in peace, back then”, because she had lost her daughter (392). Switching over to Denver’s perspective we see that unlike Sethe’s unconditional love (as in a mother should always) Denver acts in fear. She states “I love my mother but I know she killed one of her own daughters, and tender as she is with me, I'm scared of her because of it.”(398). This tells us that Denver and Sethe, but only as a mother. She recognizes that Sethe is insane, and that her two brothers left because they too knew of the murder. In Fact, the only reason she stays obediently is because she is fearful for her own life. All of Sethe’s children thereby act in their own self interest and not for their mother, while Sethe believe she is acting for her children (she states she would have joined Beloved if it weren’t for her kids).

      <p>It took many years to know</br>
Years in which she was no foe.</br>
But once she slew her own daughter,</br>
We took no chance to become fodder.</br>
So we took of running away with glee</br>
From out mother’s clutches, finally free.</br>

      <p><i> peace</i></br>
I lacked a family of any great sort</br>
Until I followed the trees to 124</br>
I settled there in a broken home</br>
With mysterious beings, spirits</br>
<i> denial, anger </i></br>
Until one day the mailman said</br>
“Your lover’s daughter she ain’t just dead</br>
Murder, she gone and killed her”</br>
So I told her you don’t go Grrr</br>
And left the house still unsure</br>
<i>depression, Acceptance</i></br>
I went to the church, full of sorrow</br>
And drunk away like no tomorrow</br>
A life with no love had no meaning</br>
So he went back to Sethe with no screaming.</br>
